        Fault analysis using frequency domain was performed on healthy bearings and defective bearings.
        The time domain analysis uses a kurtosis tool and frequency domain analysis uses fast fourier transform.
        The result of kurtosis and fast fourier transform shows the bearing condition.
        ANN was trained with statistical features of Time domain vibration signal and the output was correctly predicted using ANN.
